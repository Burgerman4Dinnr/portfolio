                        <p> My name is Kevin Barone. I was born in Jackson MS. raised most of my life in Hattiesburg MS. I lived in Argentina for 4 years, graduated high school, and now I'm back. My hobbies are gaming, going out, tech, and pretty much anything that has to do with computers. I speak two different languages, English and Spanish. I specifically speak "Castellano", because my parents are from there. "Castellano" is what the Argentinians speak. I was always into tech since I was little, when I touched my first game console. Since then, I always had my hands on a device, a console, or a PC. Because of how much access I had with them, I always gained an interest, and kept learning more, and more naturally. My first official classes I took, were my ICT class in Hattiesburg, in the 7th grade. That is where I started to learn how to type fast, and get used to the keyboard. Same during my 8th grade year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Dec. 6th, 2017, was the day I landed in South America. My life changed, not sure if it was for the good, but it's what God intended to happen. During my time, my access to such technology declined a bit, because Argentina isn't such a well-developed country, so it was difficult for me to adapt to new changes. However, right before COVID hit, I received a notice of this new class coming to town, called "Caprof". I had never heard of it, but I saw an opportunity. There were many classes to choose from, and I thought, why not graphics designing? It was a 9 month course I had to take. During the class I got a good knowledge on how to use Photoshop, and then I decided to learn how to video edit on Premiere Pro on my own. I loved learning how to use them, and then, I graduated with a graphics designing certificate. At my high school, they were also teaching ICT, but it is not the same as it is here in America. 2021 rolled along, I also graduated high school. With my diploma came an IT certificate as well. So now I have two certificates, I felt so accomplished!  Now that I have graduated high school, I have my one way ticket back to my home state of Mississippi. I had to say goodbye to my family, and it was tough, but it was time for me to start a new chapter in my life. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I landed back on March 14th, 2022, the happiest day of my life. I had to stay with my uncle for a bit until I got settled in. I got to see my friends from Hattiesburg again, and had a lot of fun with my cousin. A few months later, one of my other cousins sent me something. Some "Mississippi Coding Academies" thing. I looked through it, and I thought "this was it". I've ALWAYS wanted to learn a computer language. Who wouldn't want to literally UNDERSTAND a language of something you desire? A computer? Awesome! It's an 11 month course, and the best part, it's FREE! Did I take it? Of course! After 11 months, I graduated in May of 2023, and as of writing this on 1/26/2024, I am still on the look out for anything to jump start my career, and hoping I can one day peruse my dreams as a tech man living his life as a coder, graphic designer, or anything tech wise! As a matter of fact, one of my friends and I have already had that in mind. Is there a project we're currently working on though? We'll see ;)
